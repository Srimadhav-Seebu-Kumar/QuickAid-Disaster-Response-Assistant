## Project Vision

QuickAid is an offline-first Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to be a critical lifeline during disasters and emergencies. When infrastructure fails and internet connectivity becomes unreliable, QuickAid continues to function, providing essential information about nearby hospitals, emergency shelters, and critical resources. Our vision is to create a resilient, accessible tool that works across all devices - from smartphones to feature phones via SMS - ensuring no one is left without vital emergency information when they need it most.

## Key Features

### Offline-First Architecture

• Service Worker Technology: Complete functionality without internet connection
• Local Data Storage: Critical emergency data cached locally
• Progressive Enhancement: Automatically syncs when connection is restored

### Emergency Resource Locator

• Hospital Finder: Locate nearest hospitals with real-time capacity data
• Shelter Mapping: Emergency shelters, evacuation centers, and safe zones
• Essential Services: Pharmacies, food banks, and emergency services
• Resource Status: Live updates on availability and capacity

### Smart Routing & Navigation

• Hazard-Aware Routing: Routes that avoid flood zones, damaged roads, and danger areas
• Multi-Modal Navigation: Walking, driving, and public transport options
• Offline Maps: Pre-downloaded regional maps for navigation without internet
• Real-Time Updates: Traffic and hazard information when connectivity allows

### Universal Accessibility

• Progressive Web App: Works on all modern browsers and devices
• SMS Gateway Integration: Critical features accessible via SMS for feature phones
• Multilingual Support: Local language support for diverse communities
• Voice Navigation: Audio guidance for visually impaired users
• Low-Bandwidth Mode: Optimized for poor network conditions

### Real-Time Communication

• Emergency Broadcasts: Receive official emergency alerts and updates
• Community Reports: Crowdsourced hazard and resource information
• Family Safety: Check-in features for family coordination
• Emergency Contacts: Quick access to local emergency services
